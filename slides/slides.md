## Minimum spanning tree
+ Input: connected, **undirected** graph *G = (V, E)*,
  + with **weights** *w(u, v)* on each edge
+ Output: find a tree *T* &sube; E **connecting** all vertices
  + Minimising **total weight** \`w(T) = sum\_T w(u,v)\`
+ **Why** must *T* be a tree?  Num **edges** in *T*? **Unique**?
+ **Applications**:
  + Utilities: gas/elec/water (BorÅ¯vka, Moravia), internet
  + Image analysis: registration, OCR

## Outline of generic solution
```
def MST( V, E ):
  init A = {}
  until A spans V:
    find a "safe edge" to add
    add it to A
```
+ Build up a solution *A*, one **edge** at a time
  + Loop iterates exactly *|V| - 1* times
+ What is a "**safe edge**" to add?
  + Adding it to *A* doesn't **prevent** us from finding a MST
  + *A* starts as a **subset** of some MST
  + *A* plus the edge is **still** a subset of some MST
+ **How** do we find "safe edges"?

---
## Safe edge theorem
+ Let *A* &sube; E be a **subset** of some MST
  + Let *(S, V-S)* be a **cut**: partition the vertices
  + We say that an edge *(u, v)* **crosses the cut** iff \`u in S and v in V-S\`
  + A cut **respects** *A* iff no edge in *A* crosses the cut
  + A **light edge** crossing the cut has *min weight*
    over all edges crossing the cut
+ Theorem: any **light edge** *(u, v)* crossing a cut *(S, V-S)* that
  **respects** *A* is a **safe edge** for *A*

---
## Proof of safe edge theorem
+ Let *T* be a **MST**, and *A* &sube; T
  + Let *(S, V-S)* be a **cut** respecting *A*
  + Let *(u, v)* be a **light edge** crossing that cut
+ Since *T* is a **tree**, &exist; a **unique** path *u* &rarr; *v* in *T*
  + That path must **cross** the cut *(S, V-S)*:
  + Let *(x, y)* be an **edge** in the path that crosses the cut
  + Cut **respects** *A*, so *(x, y)* &notin; A
+ Since *(u, v)* is a **light edge**, *w(u,v)* &le; *w(x,y)*
+ So **swap** out the edge: *T'* = *T* - {*(x,y)*} &cup; {*(u,v)*}
  + Then *w(T')* &le; *w(T)*, so *T'* is also a **MST**
  + Also, *A* &cup; {*(u,v)*} &sube; *T'*, so *(u,v)* is **safe** for *A*

## Outline

## Kruskal's algorithm for MST
+ Initialise each **vertex** as its own **component**
+ **Merge** components by choosing **light edges**
  + Scan edge list in **increasing** order of weight
+ Use **disjoint-set** ADT to find crossing edges *(ch21)*
